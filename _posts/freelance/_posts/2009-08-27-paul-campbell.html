	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Hi Dmitry,
	Thanks for your email. I think you've overestimated me!</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How did you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I didn't: I just decided to use Ruby instead of PHP for a job I was working on.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p> Where, and how, do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>My only real advice is: just do good work. More usually follows. Keep
	up with standards and best practices, try to learn one new thing every
	project you do.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>Get coding!</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What have you learned in the past about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients, etc.? Many people dream about changing the past for a better present moment ... anything you want to share?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Be careful about getting too excited up front and letting it blind you
	to reality. Visualise the future and make sure you're happy with the
	perceived outcome.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books, or sites, or recipes, or whatever else you can recommend (they may be about productivity, or negotiation, or thinking - anything you think will help me live a better life as a programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> is the best book on programming I've read.</p></div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time per week do you work? How do you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Anything between 30 and 60 hours. Productivity ... it's really just
	down to the job. I find tools like Pivotal Tracker and writing
	Cucumber tests help keep me focussed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How do you organize your workspace and what tools are you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Macbook Pro / Rails / Cucumber ... I also use Passenger as a dev
	environment / Textmate and a tool called RailsTerm that sets up my
	terminals with log / db / console etc.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How do recommend becoming a successful and <strong>profitable</strong> programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Profit: spend less than you earn!</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What should every programmer know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>There's more to life than programming.</p><p>Best of luck!</p></div>
