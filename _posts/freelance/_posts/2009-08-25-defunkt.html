		<p>Hello. I have 9 questions to you about working process and programming. So, when you'll be able - please answer them. Or just some of them. I want become Ruby Pro and earning money with fun.</p></div>
	<div class="left"><p>Great!</p></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I was doing PHP consulting and convinced some of my clients to try out
	Ruby on Rails. They agreed, I gave them a bit of a discount, and
	everyone was happy.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I work full time at GitHub. Start your own company - that's a great
	way to find work ;)</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>		Open source! Write and release projects, fix bugs in other peoples'
		projects, be active in the community. The best way to improve is by
		writing and reading code.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Don't give up and don't worry. Work hard and stay focused, but don't
	work too hard. Be patient. Working hard is definitely the secret to
	success.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I love <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com">rubyinside.com</a> for staying on top of the latest Ruby news.
	I also follow many popular Rubyists like <a href="http://twitter.com/technoweenie">technoweenie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nzkoz">nzkoz</a> on
	Twitter to stay in the loop.</p>

	<p>I think the secret to being a better programmer is to stop caring what
	other people think of you, stop worrying about appearances and
	judgement, and instead just start programming. It's not easy but it's
	always the best tactic.</p></div>
 
	<div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I'm not sure. I start work between 8:30 and 10 most days, then work
	until 6 or 7 if I'm going out that night. If I'm not going out I'll
	work until 1 or 2am. I don't really worry about how many hours I work
	- instead I focus on what I need to get done.</p>

	<p>I find planning what you will do tomorrow is the best way to stay
	productive. That way it's easy to get up and immediately start working
	- no need to spend time figuring out what to do or where to start.
	Think about what you'll do tomorrow tonight.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't really have a workspace. I work from home and constantly move
	between laying in bed, working on my couch, working at my office desk,
	and working at the dinner table. I like to move around.</p>
	<p>Emacs and Git are the most important tools in my toolbox.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Like I said - work hard and write a lot of code. Don't get hung up on
	appearances or what other people think. Don't worry about reading
	about design patterns or methodologies - learn by doing.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Take breaks throughout the day. I like playing guitar and Rock Band.</p>

	<p>Thanks</p>
  </div>
 <div class="right"><p>	Chris, thank you a lot for your attention and your advices.</p></div>
