  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><ol><li>freelance eshop in my local town</li>
  <li>ror2ru posting from Yurii Rashkovskii</li></ol></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I'm searching for interesting people who i'd like to work with and learn from.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><ol><li>Read others' code;</li>
  <li>Write your code;</li>
  <li>Publish it.</li></ol></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Nothing. The past is for learning from it, not for changing it.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I'm inspired by writings and thoughts of <a href="http://dekorte.com/">Steve Dekorte</a>, <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a>, <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/">Dave Thomas</a>, <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a>, <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/">Linus Torvalds</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/">Edgar W. Dijkstra</a>. You may find their ideas in books, articles, blogs, twits, presentations, mailing list discussions. Rails/Merb guys are good at business and productivity, but not at code. Don't mix the one with another.</p></div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't count. Office work takes 40-44 hrs a week.</p>
  <p>Productivity depends on interest. When doing a boring job, try to find something to put your effort in to keep yourself interested. Learn stuff, try to do it different way.</p>

  <p>If the work is just completely stupid and you are doing it just to pay your bills, keep the focus on the ultimate goal: on something to be done. Do it as fast as you can and go home to your personal projects.</p>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Table, chair, macbook pro, tea, orange juice. Textmate and xcode for writing code and terminal to control things.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>What do you care about more: being successful, profitable or being a programmer? If you want to be happy doing some things you have interest in: evaluate your interest, make something useful for others: useful open source patch is a good start.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't care about everyone, but to be a successful and nice guy you have to know how to communicate (be patient, tolerant, listen to others, learn english and write without grammar errors), process information (== science, you must know how science works: maths, physics, biology are good examples), know "the stuff": do not just observe, but learn things: be critical to what you see around, try to improve things, constantly ask yourself "why?" about everything you don't understand.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>Please write your thoughts about being a programmer, fun and happy person.</p></div>
