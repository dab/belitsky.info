	<div class="right"><div class="message"><p>Hello there.</p></div></div>
	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Hi Dmitry.</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I first discovered Rails in late 2004 and being a Perl guy I decided
	to try and implement something like Rails in Perl. It sucked though so
	I decided to give Rails a try itself (along with Ruby). After I
	completed a basic project within a few days that would have taken a
	couple of weeks in Perl, I was sold. So my first paying Ruby related
	work was that first Rails site I built that I had intended to use Perl
	for originally. I just began using Ruby for things that I was already
	doing programming jobs for.
	</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I almost only work on my own projects now, such as the <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com">Ruby Inside
	blog</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">RubyFlow</a>. I do not actively seek out any work.</p>

	<p>My advice for anyone looking for Ruby related work would be to first
	get a name for yourself somehow, though primarily through either open
	source contributions or by developing your own Web sites. Blogging is
	also a wise step, though often your code can talk for itself. People
	want to be confident in a person's experience and abilities before
	hiring them, so having a public demonstration of this is valuable.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>	Finish some projects :) Alternatively, if that's taking a long time,
		you can comment on all Ruby related blog posts you can find as long as
		you have anything half way interesting to say (don't look like spam).
		Twitter and/or blog about things you find in Ruby that you like and
		about things that you've learned. Build up a repository of your
		presence online and keep making contacts.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Fire-Aim-Million-Agora/dp/0470182024">Ready Fire Aim by Michael Masterson</a> is invaluable for learning how to
	get things done quickly and how to get ahead in business.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483">Coders at Work by Peter Seibel</a> is a great analysis of how some of the
	world's most famous coders work and think about programming. It's not
	out till September though.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Clients-Love-Growing-Business/dp/0446527556">What Clients Love by Harry Beckwith</a> is full of useful advice if you
	plan to work as a freelancer / independently.</p>

	<p>I would also recommend reading <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real by 37signals</a>. It's
	available to read for free on their Web site.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't know. Sometimes I don't do anything I consider "work" whereas
	other times I spend many hours working away at something I'm not
	particularly enjoying. Since I work on mostly my own projects it's
	hard to define. I'd say I'm in front of a computer for about ten hours
	a day, however, but I'm often just learning things or browsing. When
	necessary, I keep myself productive by just getting on and doing
	things without procrastinating - it sounds simple but you can learn
	this stuff by adopting Getting Things Done methodologies and listening
	to some of the Tony Robbins tapes on developing strategies for your
	life/work.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I basically have a desk, two monitors, a Mac Pro, and a pencil/pen and
	paper nearby at all times. I have portable computers too but I rarely
	use them for work as I like to work at a desk mostly (though I
	sometimes have a switch for a week or two). Surrounding my desk I have
	many shelves covered in books - mostly nonfiction. I read a lot of
	books as it's the best way to learn.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't really consider myself a "successful programmer." I have built
	sites I have sold for good money that required me to program, but I
	think the business and marketing knowledge I have helped a lot more
	with those.. I could have paid someone to do the development.</p>

	<p>That said, I know a lot of successful (and sometimes wealthy)
	programmers and I'd say the wealthiest ones are those who started
	agencies/development shops (or even hosting companies) and have the
	sales skills to get major development contracts with well known
	companies. It's not the most fun stuff in the world but it's
	particularly profitable. Contracting can also be very profitable in
	certain niches (especially Java).</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Business stuff. Productivity stuff. How to produce the most suitable
	thing with the least amount of effort. How to stop working on
	something when any extra work is not significantly adding to what you
	already have.</p></div>
