teaser:  Don't hesitate too long before doing it - it's great being a freelancer if you're a self-learner, always curious of everything - and you can live with the risk. It took me about a year to decide :)

<p>Independent software consultant. Currently working in Ruby on Rails, and loving it..</p>
<ul class="contacts">

</ul>
<div class="chat elise">
	<div class="right"><div class="message"><p>Hello there. My name is Dmitry, i'm freelance web developer from Ukraine.</p><p>I choose you cause i think that you interesing person and famous Ruby developer.</p></div></div>
	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Hi Dmitri</p><p>I'm far from a famous ruby developer :)  but thank you for asking me, I'll answer you the best I can.  I agree that doing Ruby and Rails professionally is great.</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>Networking.  Before I started to freelance, I went to lots of networking events (barcamps, geekdinners, ...), and got to know many people in IT from my country.</p><p>When i announced on twitter I was going freelance, I immediately got a proposal from one of my contacts, who was looking for a Ruby programmer.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>Once again, the best way is to use social networks and contacts and let it be known you're a rubyist and available. You can do a web version of that by making your LinkedIn profile visible, and posting your profile on job sites.  You can also send your CV to local body shopping agencies.</p>

	<p>Then there's several job boards:</p>
	<ul><li><a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/jobs">workingwithrails.com/browse/jobs</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://jobs.rubynow.com/">jobs.rubynow.com</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs">jobs.37signals.com</a></li></ul>
	<p>I just subscribed to odesk.com, which is a kind of hub for freelance jobs. (generally, google rails jobs and variations) Most jobs are for the US, but sometimes they accept remote work.  You have to browse a lot to find interesting freelance work in your area.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>Make one ready project and put it online, so you have something to show.  
	Start a technical blog and make it searchable. Get to know as many people as possible, and let them know what you're doing.  In fact, it's a good idea to have a ready explanation of why RoR is good, some people will not understand 'Ruby on Rails', but they might understand Twitter or Basecamp.
	Try to get contracts where you get paid by the day, not fixed-rate projects.  It's more compatible with agile, and it's just plain easier on you.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Don't hesitate too long before doing it - it's great being a
	freelancer if you're a self-learner, always curious of everything -
	and you can live with the risk.
	It took me about a year to decide :)  I was lucky with my first customers.
	There's really nothing wrong with being an employee though, if you
	find the right environment (I haven't).</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I read the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a> a long time ago - it's pretty good,
	and mostly timeless.  I've <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=cm_srch_res_rpli_20">The art of agile development</a> 
	which was a good intro (nowadays lots of people are speaking about
	kanban, haven't looked yet).</p>
	<p>One book would recommend to any beginning rails freelancer:
	<a href="http://www.railsfreelancebook.com">railsfreelancebook.com/</a>
	</p>
	<p>Read blogs from good rubyists and follow the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a>
	(you probably know about that already :) )</p></div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Usually about i work about 40-50hrs, not more.
	to keep focused i do other things next to my work :)  Air your brain a little.
	When you're a freelancer, and you don't have a family, loneliness can
	be an issue.  You don't have a group of colleagues. I share a space
	with 2 co-workers, but of course you need some income before you can
	afford that.  So make sure you keep hold of your friends :)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I use rubymine or textmate depending on the mood, and vi.  Lots of
	command line.  git of course. capistrano.  the usual
	I try to keep my workspace clean, i work better when it's uncluttered.
	I have my macbook pro and a large extra screen.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't know :)  seriously, probably a combination of being nice,
	reasonably sociable, honest, having common sense (about money and
	projects), not being afraid of putting yourself out there, trying new
	things on a regular basis, keeping up with what's happening.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Hm ... probably that you can't do everything on your own, you need to
	be able to fit in in a team.  the concept of 'rock star' is stupid.
	And then all the stuff in 'Pragmatic Programmers' :)</p>
	<p>I hope I answered your questions and that the answers will help.
	Good luck and lots of success !</p><p>Elise</p></div>
