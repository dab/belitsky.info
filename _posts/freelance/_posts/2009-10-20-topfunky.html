  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>My very first paying Ruby work was an existing contract that I
  convinced the client to use Ruby for.</p>
  <p>My next Ruby contract was a job posting that I replied to. It turned
  out that the client knew of my recent blog posts and hired me.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I run <a href="http://peepcode.com">PeepCode Screencasts</a> full time and am not
  doing other consulting work.</p>

  <p>I would suggest contributing to open source projects or create your
  own project so you have quality code to show a potential employer.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>  Fix bugs in an existing one. Write tests for an existing project that
    doesn't have many.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Find one good client and stick with it. It's much more difficult to
  work for many clients at once (especially if you are working solo).</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
    <p>Of course, <a href="http://peepcode.com">PeepCode</a> . I keep up on news with a
    site I made: <a href="http://news.peepcode.com/">news.peepcode.com</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> has some of the best articles I've read on productivity
    and programming.</p>
    <p>I keep a todo list in several ways. Currently I prioritize with Things
    (iPhone) and Emacs org-mode (individual projects).</p>

  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I work full time, at least 40 hours a week. I keep productive by</p>
  <ul>  
    <li>Getting up early (I'm most productive in the morning)</li>
    <li>Scheduling blocks of time to focus</li>
    <li>Working on projects first thing in the morning and checking email later</li>
    <li>Hiring a few top-notch assistants to do customer service and other</li>
    <li>non-programming tasks</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>In my home office I run an 8-core Mac Pro with 20 and 24 inch Dell
  screens for video editing and rendering. On the road I run a 13"
  MacBook Pro. The SSD has made a huge difference in how often I have to
  wait for the computer. Highly recommended for only about $200.</p>

  <p>Most of the time I'm in Emacs for text editing and task management. I
  try to focus on one thing at a time as much as possible, so I run it
  full screen and hide other applications. The only application that I
  run when the computer starts is LaunchBar (for quickly jumping to
  files, starting applications, sending files to applications, and
  searching Google).</p>

  <p>I run IM only infrequently and am rarely on IRC. One of the most
  productive things I've found is to go to a local coffee shop with
  flaky WiFi, so I can't go on the Internet even if I want to!</p>

  <p>For email I use <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com">MailPlane</a> with Google Gears
  so I can use Gmail offline.</p>

  <p>For PeepCode, my favorite application is Adobe After Effects. It's an
  amazing application and I wish that Adobe's other applications were as
  efficient and well designed.</p>

  <p>It's always a conflict between spending time optimizing my workflow
  (shell scripts, aliases, rake tasks) or just sticking to work. I've
  ended up with a huge number of useful aliases for creating remote Git
  repos, rendering After Effects animations, etc.</p>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>A complicated question! Figure out what you want to do and find a way
  to accomplish it. Starting my own business is one of the best choices
  I've made, but it's also stressful and means that I spend less time
  writing code and more time on the business. If you just love to
  program, find a stable company so you can focus on code. If you want
  to run your own show, experiment with a bunch of ideas until you find
  one that's profitable. There are many good business ideas that haven't
  been implemented yet, or have been done poorly.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Keep learning.</p></div>
  
  <div class="right"><p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p></div>
