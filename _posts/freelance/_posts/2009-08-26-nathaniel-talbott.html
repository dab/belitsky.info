  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I was doing a contract project, and the client didn't care what I used
	so I used Ruby. This was back in 2003, before Rails came around.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>Most work comes to me, in the form of people finding Terralien and
	getting in touch about projects. This is insufficient, though, and I'm
	always trying to find better and more reliable sources of work.</p>

	<p>For a solo guy like yourself, it largely depends: are you looking for
	freelance work? Or are you looking for full-time employment. In either
	case it's all about networking - talking to people, getting the word
	out about what you do - but it's two different networks. My suggestion
	would be to read "My Job Went to India" or its newer edition, "The
	Passionate Programmer" - Chad does an amazing job of giving you the
	same sort of advice I would give you if I had the time to write it all
	down!</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>	Two things: work on open source projects, and get involved in the
		community. For community, look for local folks to get together with,
		go to a conference or two, and spend time on mailing lists and in
		forums contributing to the discussion.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I wish I'd found ways to work on side projects with other people
	sooner than I did. Tackling something with a couple of other folks
	increases the learning by an order of magnitude, since you get to
	learn from each other.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I always recommend reading and applying "Getting Things Done" by David
	Allen. It will give you the tools to build a productive system that
	works for you.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>These days I spend most of my time doing business, not programming.
	From what I've seen, the key to being profitable long-term is to spend
	time on long-term projects. In particular, start building a business
	(or two or three) on the side that can make money outside of your day
	job. Side businesses are both great for learning and also have the
	potential to become full-time jobs that are much more consistent than
	either freelance work or working for a company.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I think more about what every programmer should *be*: they should be
	so passionate about programming that they would do it even if they
	couldn't get paid for it. Cultivate that passion, and you'll find it
	easier and easier to get paid to put it into practice.</p>

	<p>I hope this helps - I'm impressed with your initiative to put this
	interview together!</p>

 <div class="right"><p>	Thank you very much, Nathaniel!
	It was very interesting to read your advices.</p></div>
