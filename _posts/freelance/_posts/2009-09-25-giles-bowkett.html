<div class="chat giles">
	<div class="right"><div class="message"><p>Hello there. My name is Dmitry, i'm freelance web developer from Ukraine.</p><p>I choose you cause i think that you interesing person and famous Ruby developer.</p></div></div>
	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Hi Dmitry. Thank you.</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>Well, it was 2006 and I googled everywhere, asked everybody I knew, to
  see if I could find anybody in my town who was doing Rails stuff.
  Rails was still new and I lived in New Mexico, which only has a few
  tech companies, but I found them, got people to introduce me, and at
  first I did some work for free just to get my feet wet.
  </p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>The best way is referrals from people you know. I live in a big city
  now so there are lots of job ads and stuff but referrals are better.
  Obviously when you're getting started that's a contradiction, though.
  You can't get referrals until you've worked with somebody. So look for
  ads, google like crazy, and meet people if you can. Don't be a stalker
  or anything but if you know a cool company that you want to work for,
  get in touch with them, the worst they can do is say no.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>Submit patches to open source projects, even if you think your code
    isn't ready. Best way to learn, hands down, and best way to meet other
    Ruby devs as well. <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is where it's at. Join <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and get
    hacking. :-)</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I would say that there really is no such thing as a good client.
  Consulting is actually not a great business model. It's much better to
  make your own web site that people pay to use than it is to do
  consulting for anybody. I would say get on that as quick as you can.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Heh, I work like 10 hours a week and I have no cash at all. This is
  kind of unusual, though. Usually I work 40 hours. Best way to keep
  yourself productive and focused is to make a list of what you want to
  do. Not just today, but in your life. A list of goals for the future.
  Make sure to do that every day, and you'll stay focused.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I use vim, TextMate, heavily customized OS X, and two computers, one
  on the left, one on the right. The one on the right has two monitors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Learn about business and marketing. Also get really good at programming.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Business and marketing. :-) Also lambdas, higher-order functions, good
  OOP, SQL, learn Rails inside-out, know what all the code does and how
  it does it, even the stuff that you never ever need to modify.</p></div>
  
  <div class="right">
    <p>Please write your thoughts about being a programmer, fun and happy person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p>I guess the key is to have fun. :-) Also really know what you're
    doing. And always think about improving your business. When you get to
    the point where you have clients, that's awesome, until after a while
    you realize that consulting isn't a great business model. You're
    always going to have a next step on the horizon, so be dilligent about
    what you're doing, research the next step, and stay on focus.</p>

    <p>Also make sure to WRITE A LOT OF CODE! It's often just as simple as
    that. In fact I'd say that might be more important than anything.</p>
