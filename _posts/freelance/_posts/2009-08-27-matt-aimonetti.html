  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How did you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I was working in a company that was frustrated by the technology we were using. We looked at different technologies, including Python and Ruby and the engineering team decided to go with Ruby after we fell in love with its syntax and philosophy.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p> Where, and how, do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>Most of my clients find me by referrals, or because they read my blog or heard me talk at a conference/meeting. Word of mouth is very important in our business and it's probably the best way to keep working on exciting projects.
	My advice would be to start a blog, write interesting stuff, release an open source project or contribute to other projects.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books, or sites, or recipes, or whatever else you can recommend (they may be about productivity, or negotiation, or thinking - anything you think will help me live a better life as a programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left">Probably <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097451408X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0201699699&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0MY406E60M6Q3NFZVZ5S">Practices of an Agile Developer: Working in the Real World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251142920&sr=1-2">The Ruby Programming Language</a>.</div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time per week do you work? How do you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>My wife and I don't seem to agree on the definition of "work". I bill around 35 hours of work per week. However I probably spend 80 hours developing software. So half of my development time is paid for, the rest is for fun or to help the community.
	I keep myself productive by working with people challenging me. I'm the most focused when I'm facing a hard problem. Otherwise, take some short breaks, enjoy your weekends and learn to relax to be more efficient when working.</p>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How do you organize your workspace and what tools are you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I don't think I have any special organization or tools I use. I try to keep my desk tidy so I don't get distracted ;)</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How do recommend becoming a successful and <strong>profitable</strong> programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>These are two different notions. Choose your priorities, if your goal is to make lots of money, you chose the wrong career ;)</p>
	<p>My only advice on the topic: be passionate.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What should every programmer know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>That your own knowledge will always be limited, learn how to adapt and solve problems you never encountered, that's what makes good developers.</p></div>

    <p>Thank you!</p>
