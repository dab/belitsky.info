<div class="chat jamis">
	<div class="right"><div class="message"><p>Hello there. My name is Dmitry, i'm freelance web developer from Ukraine.</p><p>I choose you cause i think that you interesing person and famous Ruby developer.</p></div></div>
	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Hello Dmitry! Thank-you for your email. I apologize for taking so long
  to respond; I received your email when I was trying to get my talk
  ready for the Ruby Hoedown at the end of August, and then I forgot to
  get back to you!</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How did you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>It actually found me. :) I had been tinkering with Ruby for several
  years, but was doing work in C and Java professionally, at Brigham
  Young Unversity. In 2004 I attended the RubyConf in Washington, DC.
  There I met David Heinemeier Hansson. I had been working on the SQLite
  and SQLite3 bindings for Ruby, and DHH was looking for a simple
  database to bundle with Rails (he later decided not to). So he and I
  talked, and I wrote the first version of the SQLite adapter for Rails
  at that conference. Shortly afterward, he contacted me and asked if I
  could do some contract work for 37signals, and a few months after
  _that_, 37signals made me an offer to come on full time. I started
  there in March 2005, and have been happily hacking in Ruby ever since!
  </p></div>
  <div class="right"><p> Where, and how, do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I'm actually not searching for work, so I'm not well suited to answer
  this question. I guess my advice is to be active in open source work,
  and build your portfolio that way. It's what worked for me!</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>  Find an existing project that you like, dig into it, learn the code
    base, find what work needs to be done on it, and start submitting
    patches. You'll have many that will be rejected, but by paying
    attention to the feedback on the failed patches and trying again and
    again, you'll learn what the project leaders want and eventually,
    you'll find yourself with a few accepted patches under your belt! From
    there, you can start to get an idea of how open source projects are
    run, and you could start tinkering with ideas of your own, starting
    your own projects and putting your code into the wild. It's a great
    way to get feedback and improve yourself.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What have you learned in the past about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients, etc.? Many people dream about changing the past for a better present moment ... anything you want to share?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Well, although I did consulting work for 37signals for a few months,
  I've never really been an active "consultant", so I don't really have
  any advice about finding or working with clients. However, if I had
  the chance to tell my past self something, I think I'd say "don't burn
  yourself out." The last year or two have been hard for me, because I
  DID burn myself out. I lost much of my desire to write software, which
  was dangerous because that's what pays the bills! I'm coming out of it
  now, but I think I would definitely advise myself to use moderation,
  have non-virtual hobbies, spend more time away from the computer, etc.
  When you do that, the time you spend at the keyboard becomes all the
  more effective, because you have to ration it better.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books, or sites, or recipes, or whatever else you can recommend (they may be about productivity, or negotiation, or thinking - anything you think will help me live a better life as a programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Chad Fowler's "The Passionate Programmer"</a> is amazing. Also <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">"The
  Pragmatic Programmer" by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt</a>. Those books teach
  you how to excel at your career, and not just how to write code.</p></div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time per week do you work? How do you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I try pretty hard to stick to a 40 hour work-week, and sometimes it's
  even less than that (during the summer, 37signals institutes a 4-day
  work week!). Working long hours is a good way to burn yourself out and
  drain your productivity, so try to work less, not more. There are
  always going to be deadlines, and the occassional late night, and so
  forth, but make those the exception, not the rule. Live for something
  other than work!</p>

  <p>I also have a stand-up desk, and work about 1/3 of the time standing
  up, 1/3 of the time sitting (on a bar stool), and a 1/3 of the time
  "leaning" against the bar stool (semi-sitting, semi-standing). I find
  that changing position and posture every so often keeps me focused.
  Also, I've lately been trying to have far fewer windows open at a
  time, and only opening my email once an hour or so (instead of having
  it open constantly). Fewer distractions == higher productivity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How do you organize your workspace and what tools are you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I use a Mac, and although I used to use "Spaces" to have multiple
  virtual desktops, I've gone to having only a single virtual space
  where everything resides. (This helps to force me to reduce what I
  have open, and to reduce distractions).</p>

  <p>My toolset includes vim (MacVim, specifically), Firefox, MRI ruby
  (1.8.6, though I've been dabbling in 1.9.1 as well), <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>, iChat (which I hate) and Adium (which I
  love).</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>How do recommend becoming a successful and <strong>profitable</strong> programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Love what you do. Make time weekly (if not more frequently) to improve
  yourself by learning something you didn't know before (e.g., a library
  you use that you had never look inside before, or a new programming
  language). Participate in open source; it's a great way to get your
  name out there and associated with actual, working code.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What should every programmer know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>"Programming is not everything." You'll be a better programmer, if you
  have interests outside of computers. If you don't have any such
  interests, find some!</p></div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>Please write your thoughts about being a programmer, fun and happy person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="left"><p>I don't have much more to add, really, except to reiterate that you
  should be well balanced. Computers are great and everything, but you
  should definitely have hobbies that are completely unrelated to
  computers. In the last two years I've taken up both wood carving, and
  string figuring, and they have helped me immensely in recovering from
  burn out.</p>

  <p>Hope that helps! And again, I'm sorry I took so long to respond.</p>
