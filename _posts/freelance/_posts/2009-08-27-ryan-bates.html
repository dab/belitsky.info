	<div class="right"><div class="message"><p>Hello there. My name is Dmitry, i'm freelance web developer from Ukraine.</p><p>I choose you cause i think that you interesing person and famous Ruby developer.</p></div></div>
	<div class="left"><div class="message"><p>Thanks for the honor of participating in this interview. I couldn't get to them all but here are some of my answers.</p></div></div>
  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I was working on a large PHP site which was getting unwieldy. I looked into alternatives and Ruby on Rails seemed like the best choice. I first used it to build a smaller site and then rewrote the larger PHP app in it.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I am still employed full time at that same job. However I have received offers for consulting and other projects. It helps to get your name out there and build up a reputation in the community. Create some open-source tools that are useful to others and help answer questions. You will learn a lot from this. Also add your name to <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/">workingwithrails.com</a> and start building a profile.</p>
	<p>There are also several job sites out there which can help you find something. If you can't find anything in your local area consider working remotely.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>If you are new to programming and Ruby, start with some beginner books and tutorials. However, there comes a time shortly afterwards you need to leap into a real project. Start with something small but is useful in the real world. Half of the battle then is learning how to use Google and research topics which you aren't familiar with.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>The <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a> is one of my favorite books on programming along with Refactoring. However neither of these are going to do much for you if you do not keep programming and continue looking for ways to improve yourself.</p>

		<p>There are hundreds of great sites on Ruby and Rails, too many to list here. But ultimately you want to get very familiar with the documentation: reading RDocs, etc. Beyond this there are a ton of blogs and other useful tutorials. I usually just use Google to find the resources I need for a given task.</p></div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I have a full time job working on a Ruby on Rails site, however I also work on Railscasts during the weekends. Staying focused and motivating myself is a challenge. I like to dedicate blocks of time to working on something and avoid interruptions.</p>
	<p>I keep a very simple todo list which is just a text file of the various things I want to accomplish that day or week. I have tried many productivity applications but I find I spend too much time organizing my tasks rather than doing them. Keeping it plain text helps.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Mac OS X Terminal, TextMate and Safari are the primary applications I use. I rarely find the need to go outside of these.</p><p>Thanks for the interview!</p></div>

  <div class="right">
    <p>Thank you very much!</p>
