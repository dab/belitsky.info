  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you find your first Ruby related job?</p></div></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I worked for ThoughtWorks where a Ruby practice was formed by Obie Fernandez. I was lucky enough to get on a Ruby project while working with them.</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>Where and how do you search for work now? Can you give me some advice on the best ways to find some Ruby related work?</p></div>
  <div class="left"><p>I would suggest building something you can show off and then checking some of the ruby on rails blogs for jobs. <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/jobs">Here</a> is a good place to look however I wouldn't try to get a job doing Ruby and Ruby On Rails until you have a good bit of experience. </p></div>

  <div class="right"><p> What advice would you give a Ruby beginner without any projects ready to show?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
	<p>Pick something to build. Look at the world around you and think of something that might help. Maybe your friend wants to be able to locate the playgrounds near their house.. build an app to let them. Things like that. Make sure to ready blogs. The code kata's are a good place to go to practice as well as the ruby quiz site.  <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">rubyquiz.com</a> and <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">codekata.pragprog.com</a> (the kata's are on the left)</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What you want tell to past yourself from present moment about working with Ruby, clients, how to find good clients etc.? You know, many people dreaming about changing past for better present moment, so anything you want to change in past yourself, write about it.</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Nope everything before has lead to here so I am good with the past. If I feel I haven't done something I should, I make myself do it now.</p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What books or sites or recipes or whatever else you can recommend (it may be about productivity or negotiation or thinking - anything you think will help me live better life as programmer)?</p></div>

  <div class="left">
    <p>See above</p>
  </div>


  <div class="right"><p>How much time a week you work and how you keep yourself productive and focused?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>40 hours a week and I stay productive because I pair all the time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><div class="message"><p>How you organize your workspace and what tools you using while working?</p></div></div>

  <div class="left"><p>I use the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ruby = language</li>
      <li>Rails = framework (Obie wrote "The Rails Way")</li>
      <li>Git = version control</li>
      <li>Cucumber = integration testing</li>
      <li>Rspec = unit testing</li>
      <li>MongoDB = document database</li>
      <li>Postgres = relational database</li>
      <li>MySql = relational database</li>
      <li>SqlLite = relational database</li>
      <li>Vim = code editor</li>
      <li>Pivotal Tracker = story cards/project management</li>
      <li>Basecamp = document sharing and collaboration</li>
      <li>Engine Yard = staging site hosting provider</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="right"><p>How to be successful and *profitable* programmer?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Look up some of Obie's presentations. </p></div>

  <div class="right"><p>What every programmer should know?</p></div>

  <div class="left"><p>Lots of stuff.</p><p>I hope this was helpful.</p></div>
  
  <div class="right"><p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p></div>
